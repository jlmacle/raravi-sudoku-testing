End-to-end testing code for the [Sudoku application](https://github.com/raravi/sudoku) <br>
written by Amith Raravi, <br>
and forked to this repository.<br><br>

The e2e scripts are in the folder <b>zz_e2e_tests</b>.

To explain the choice of Java, <br>
I decided to consider a case where a choice would be made to mix Cypress and Selenium. <br>
I keep this structure for the moment for personal reasons.

<u>Requirements</u>:<br>
<code>npm install</code>
and a Maven project update.
